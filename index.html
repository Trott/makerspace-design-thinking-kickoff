# Design Thinking

???

So, as Jim said, we're going to be using Design Thinking on this project.

---

class: center, middle

# Why?

???

You may be wondering why.

---

class: center, middle

# "Anything different is good."
#### -Phil (Bill Murray) in _Groundhog Day_

???

It's because if this is going to fail, let's have it *not* be because we did the same-old same-old of gathering a committee, sitting around an brainstorming, and putting together a recommendation document, and then dispersing and having nothing happen.

---

class: center, middle

# Let's have fun!

???

A maker space is supposed to be fun and creative and spark innovation; why shouldn't our process reflect that?

---

class: center, middle

# Eating our own dog food.

???

In fact, what is wrong with us if we *don't* embrace that?

---

class: center, middle

# You want me to live, right?

???

Plus, to be honest, I'd rather you drop a train on me than make me slog through another business-as-usual committee.

---

class: center, middle

# So, what is it already?

???

Design thinking is a lot of things.

---

class: center, middle

# Who cares?

???

If you really want to know, Google it; I don't have a lot of time here.

---

class: center, middle 

# Let's start!

???

But let's jump in and start.

---

class: center, middle 

# Human-Centered

???

Let's identify our problem in a human-centered way.

---

class: center, middle

# "Create a space where people can collaborate and innovate!"

???

Something like this?

---

class: center, middle

# Ha ha ha!
# No.

???

That's all about the space, not about the people.

---

class: center, middle

# "Understand creative innovators and how they get things done."

???

This is better; I'm open to ideas to improve it.

---

class: center, middle

# Stand up.

???

Now that we've agreed on how to frame the problem, stand up.

---

class: center, middle

# Jumping Jacks!

???

Do ten jumping jacks with me!

---

class: center, middle

# WTF?

???

I wanted to cue you that we're doing things a little differently and that you should bring energy to this thing.

---

class: center, middle

<!-- hotlinking is lame, sorry -->

???

Plus, I've always secretly wanted to be Richard Simmons.

---
class: center, middle

# What next?

???

We're going to take a trip to an existing maker space and see how it's set up.

---
class: center, middle

# Human-centered.

???

More importantly, we're going to see how people use it to get stuff done.

---

class: center, middle

# What if people aren't using it?

???

If no one's using it, we're still going to explore it and, more importantly, we're going to interview the people who run it to find out how people use it to get stuff done.

---

class: center, middle

# Good ideas.

???

This will hopefully help us generate good ideas, either stealing them from the existing space, building on ideas from the existing space, or just sort of randomly coming up with stuff that is weirdly spurred in inexplicable ways by getting out and seeing someplace else.

---

class: center, middle

# Pitfalls.

???

It will also help us identify pitfalls to avoid.

---

class: center, middle

# Bring your camera(phone).

???

Take lots of photos!

---

class: center, middle

# Bring your notepad!

???

Take lots of notes!

---

class: center, middle

# Do not rely on memory!

???

Your memory is not as good as you think it is!

---

class: center, middle

# Go for stories!

???

Narratives rule; boring technical details can come some other time.

---

class: center, middle

# That's all for now!

???

More later!

---

class: center, middle

#### Except this:
# Have fun!

???

One other thing, though: If we aren't having fun doing this, we are doing it wrong!
